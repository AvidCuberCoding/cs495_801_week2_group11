This summer I spent a lot of time working on personal projects using the MERN stack. When I was not working,
I spent time with family. I spent most of my free time playing video games with friends.

This summer I interned at DeveloperTown doing Xamarin and React development. When I wasn't working, I spent
my time walking the Indianapolis canal and playing Fall Guys.
